## 🛠️ Practical Application: Using the Clean Code Pattern

When working with AI to write or review code, follow this sequence:
1. **Inject Pattern:** Copy the content of `prompts/patterns/clean-code-standards-v1.0.0.md`.
2. **Inject Role Prompt:** Copy the `dev-best-practices-reviewer-v1.0.0.md`.
3. **Execution:** Provide your code snippet for review.

This combination ensures the AI uses a "Senior Developer" mindset to audit your work.
